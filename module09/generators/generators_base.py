'''
To recap, iterators are objects that can be iterated on, and generators are special functions 
that leverage lazy evaluation. Implementing your own iterator means you must create an __iter__() 
and __next__() method, whereas a generator can be implemented using the yield keyword in 
a Python function or comprehension. 

You may prefer to use a custom iterator over a generator when you require an object with complex 
state-maintaining behavior or if you wish to expose other methods beyond __next__(), __iter__(), 
and __init__(). On the other hand, a generator may be preferable when dealing with large sets 
of data since they do not store their contents in memory or when it is not necessary to implement 
an iterator.
